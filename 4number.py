# Python Numbers
'''
There are three numeric types in Python:

int - Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
float - Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
complex - Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:
'''

x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 3+5j   # complex


# Type Conversion
'''
You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods:
You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.
'''
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

#convert from int to float:
a = float(x)

#convert from float to int:
b = int(y)

#convert from int to complex:
c = complex(x)
